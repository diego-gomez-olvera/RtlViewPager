# RtlViewPager
Fork of the RtlViewPager. ViewPager that displays items from right to left for RTL locales and behaves like a regular ViewPager otherwise

### Acknowledgment
The repository is a fork of RtlViewPager with some additional fixes. This module was originally developed for Booking.com. With approval from Booking.com, this module was generalized and published on GitHub and jCenter.

### How to use

The library is published to the jcenter repository, thus your *project's* `build.gradle` must contain:

```groovy
repositories {
    jcenter()
}
```

To use this library add following to your *module's* `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'com.yotadevices.widget:rtlviewpager:1.0.3'
}
```

That is all. You can use RtlViewPager the same way you use android ViewPager.
